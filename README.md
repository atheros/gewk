About
-----

This is the firmware for G.E.W.K project: https://hackaday.io/project/13067-garden-of-eden-watering-kit


Status

Currently all the code does is display the status screen and run all pumps.


IDE
---

From the very beginning I wanted to use some proper IDE, so I decided to use Sloeber IDE
(http://eclipse.baeyens.it/). Setting it up for Teensy is a bit tricky but totally possible.
See http://eclipse.baeyens.it/how_to.shtml#/i
